# Akkadict
Akkadian dictionary Webapp written in C# with procedural noun inflection (and later verb declensions)

Made during nwHacks 2019 in order to learn Blazor and keep myself from failing my Akkadian course.

Inflection generation is very barebones and doesn't take phonological changes into account.

Uses Blazor, so install that and do `dotnet run` or `dotnet watch run`.
